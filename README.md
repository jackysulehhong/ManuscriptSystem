# ManuscriptSystem
Summary: 
The system's goal is to allow the editor to track the author's manuscript's progress. Essentially, the approach allows authors to upload their manuscript to the web and 
have it checked by an editor. The confirmed manuscript will be sent to a reviewer who will score and comment on it. The editor will then send the manuscript's rating 
and feedback to the author in order to help finalize it. Once the manuscript is approved, it will be sent to the publishing department.
